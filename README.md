# Wids-Midterm
This project explores how satellite imagery, climate data, and machine learning can be combined to identify areas with potential for solar and wind energy.
It is designed as a first-level suitability analysis, not a final site selection tool.

The workflow is implemented using Google Earth Engine and Python.
